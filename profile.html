					<h3>Myers-Briggs</h3>
					<p>For my Myers-Briggs test, I have used <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/" target=_blank>16Personalities</a>.</p>
					 <p>My test determined me to be a turbulent mediator <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality" target=_blank>(INFP-T)</a>. My role is a diplomat.</p>

					<h3>Online learning style</h3>
					<p>The results of my <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/learning-style-quiz-4076781" target=_blank>Online Learning Style Test</a> suggest I am a visual learner,
					studying best using charts and pictures to represent information. I prefer demonstrations,
					diagrams, slides, charts, and other visual aids particularly when I am studying alone.
					In groups, it suggests I use aids such as flash cards.</p>

					<h3>Open source psychometrics project</h3>
					<p>I have also taken the <a href="https://openpsychometrics.org/tests/IPIP-BFFM/" target="_blank">Big Five Personilty Test</a>.<br> This is based on <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1992-25730-001?doi=1" target="_blank">The development of markers for the Big-Five factor structure, by Lewis R. Goldberg</a></p>

				<li>
					<p>Most of this came as no surprise to me, after all, I have always been in introvert who tends to work impulsively. This has lead me to form schedules I can relax into, rather than sticking to a rigid plan. When it comes to working in a team, I am not usually one to do all the leading, nor the following. I prefer to work concurrently, bouncing off my colleagues' strengths. In any case, I've never been too picky about who I work with, as I rarely find a type of person I clash with. In saying this, I would prefer to be working with people less like myself, and I have always performed better in a diverse environment.
