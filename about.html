					<p>
					My name is Alan, an Iraqi born <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_people" target="_blank">Assyrian</a>, raised in Australia. Being a first generation immigrant, I am bilingual. With my family, I speak Assyrian, and with everyone else, Australian English.</p>

					<p>My partner and I parent two cats, Goma and Maro, please follow them on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/goma.to.maro/?hl=en" target="_blank">instagram</a>. My partner is from Saitama, Japan. I am eternally grateful I have her enriching my life with her culture.</p>

					<p>I have been in the hospitality industry for nine years, working in many hatted restaurants, and managing a few. After almost a decade, I came to the conclusion that I would much prefer a career that I can take anywhere with me, includng my living room. This is where my interest in remote IT work was born.

				<h3>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any)</h3>
					<p>
					It is common knowledge that without IT, society as we know would operate in a vastly different way. My first brush with IT was learning programming in an engineering degree nearly a decade ago. I did not enjoy it.<br>
					It wasn't until I developed a true yearning for remote work that I decided this would be a great launch pad.
					I put it off until a friend a made in Tokyo encouraged me to take it on, as Japan is surprisingly lacking in this industry.</p>

					<h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </h3>

					<p>RMIT offers this course online, and due to my schedule, I have opted for this style of learning.</p>

					<h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h3>

					<p>I aim to be exposed to the industry as a whole, sharpen my development skillset, and continue learning new skills relative to IT.</p>
