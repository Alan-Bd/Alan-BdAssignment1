INTEREST IN IT

What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any)

It is common knowledge that without IT, society as we know would operate in a vastly different way.
My first brush with IT was learning programming in an engineering degree nearly a decade ago. I did not enjoy it.
It wasn't until I developed a true yearning for remote work that I decided this would be a great launch pad.
I put it off until a friend a made in Tokyo encouraged me to take it on, as Japan is surprisingly lacking in this industry.

Why did you choose to come to RMIT? 

RMIT offers this course online, and due to my schedule, I have opted for this style of learning.

What do you expect to learn during your studies? 

I aim to be exposed to the industry as a whole, sharpen my development skillset, and continue learning new skills relative to IT.
