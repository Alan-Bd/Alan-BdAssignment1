				<h1 class="page-title">My project Idea: InRes, an intuitive reservations system for restaurants.</h1>
			<ul id="dialogue">
				<li>
					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>
					This system is designed for larger, high volume restaurants, and will act as a reservations system, point of sale, and database. A database for customer profiles, inventory, and real-time traffic. It will ensure an efficient and up to date means of making a reservation, whether by phone or on the app. It will also store a guest's order at each visit, updating the stock count upon order. When a repeat guest makes a reservation, the restaurant will be notified of any stock they may need for that visit. The guest will be able to access their dining history, amend a reservation, leave a review, and make any requests using the app.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Motivation</h3>
					<p>
						In such a competitive industry, margins tend to be low, so customer retention is a necessity. Having this edge will allow restaurants to create a loyalty program, anticipate their guests, and plan a service accordingly while monitoring stock counts. The more a restaurant knows about a guest, the more personal their experience can be made, from names being on invoices, to having preferred drinks ready upon arrival. A POS integrated, efficient database is needed, as inventory management can be complicated in bars and restaurants<cite>[1]</cite>.Using a universal inventory management gives restaurants an all in one toolkit to maintain consistency throughout all aspects of their duties.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<p>Guest reservations are made using an app to build on their profile, or manually over the phone. The restaurant will have access to this profile, and any previous visits made. Their table will be allocated accordingly, and relevant guest information such as dietary requirements and preferences will be made known. This will assess the current stock count and suggest stock required for this period. The guest will receive a confirmation and an automatic reminder will be set. If a guest wishes to cancel, they can do so using the app. If the restaurant requires card confirmation, this may also be securely stored. Before service, restaurants can view the predicted volume and estimated revenue. This will allow management to organize a roster and allocate staff.</p>
					<p>Once a guest has been seated, the restaurant's traffic volume will be updated, alerting last-minute bookers. Orders are placed using the point of sale, and if the open table has an attached profile, the order will be added to it. Accordingly, inventory will be updated in realtime, alerting staff of low counts throughout service. A guest may choose a hard copy of their bill, or have it sent to their profile, giving them the option to pay on the app. If indeed a hard copy is requested, it will be personalized with their name. Upon payment, the table will be unallocated based on a time frame the restaurant has set to recover the table.  Upon vacating, guests are given the option to leave a review. Their profile will accrue loyalty points, and provide them with incentives made customizable to the restaurant.</p>
					<p>On the conclusion of a service, management may view the next service, and allow the inventory manager to reorder what will be required. This can be broken up into departments, such as pastry, produce, beverage, and takeaway needs if required.</p>
					<p>If the restaurant chooses, its customer database may be integrated with a larger reservations manager, such as OpenTable.</p>
					<p>Business insights, such as financial breakdowns and traffic graphs may be accessed after a service. This will allow for ease of bookkeeping and may be filtered and synchronized accordingly.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
					 <p>General point of sale hardware will be required,  such as touch screen terminals, and mobile EFTPOS terminals. The reservations platform can be accessed on any device, such as a PC or tablet running on Windows, Mac, or Linux. Information will be stored using a private PaaS cloud model. Cloud services are far more scalable, and will allow a restaurant to expand to different locations and other groups<cite>[2]</cite> A clean reservations interface will require relevant tools such as HTML and CSS. SAP ASE will be needed for data management storage. A high level of cyber security is needed when working with sensitive client information, particularly in high volume businesses that tend to skim over various details to maintain a fast pace.<cite>[3]</cite></p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h3>Outcome</h3>
					<p>This system will serve both the restaurant and the guest. It will assist restaurants by taking out the guesswork and anticipation of staying on top of inventory, as well as keeping the contact time between administration and customer to a minimum, allowing them to enjoy a hassle-free restaurant experience. Guests will be rewarded using this platform, allowing restaurants to retain their customer base.</p>
